# self-hosted-services

This repository contains everything you need to start self-hosting a core set of privacy-preserving services that I have found helpful, all run via a common [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for SSL certificates.

## Requirements

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Ports `80/tcp`, `443/tcp`, `18080/tcp`, `18083/tcp`, `3333/tcp`, `37889/tcp`, and `18089/tcp` exposed/forwarded to the host
* DNS entries for your top-level domain and each desired sub-domain

## Included Services

* [Nextcloud](https://github.com/nextcloud/server)
  * A self-hosted server for hosting files, photos, backups, contacts, calendars, and much more
* [Uptime-kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)
  * It is a self-hosted monitoring tool like "Uptime Robot"
* [Libretranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate)
  * Free and Open Source Machine Translation API, entirely self-hosted
* [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng)
  * a privacy-respecting, hackable metasearch engine
* [Send](https://github.com/timvisee/send)
  * a fork of Mozillas's Firefox Send, which was an encrypted file sharing tool
* [Wordpress](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress)

* [Monero](https://github.com/sethforprivacy/simple-monerod-docker)
  * A self-sovereign, private-by-default, digital cash
  * This service runs a pruned Monero node, allowing you to connect your own Monero wallet(s) directly to your own node
* [Nitter](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter)
  * A privacy-preserving Twitter front-end
* [PrivateBin](https://privatebin.info/)
  * A privacy-preserving and encrypted-by-default pastebin
* [Libreddit](https://github.com/spikecodes/libreddit)
  * A privacy-preserving Reddit front-end

  * A privacy-preserving article reader in the vein of Pocket
* [Monero blockchain explorer](https://github.com/moneroexamples/onion-monero-blockchain-explorer)
  * A self-hosted Monero blockchain explorer

*NOTE: If you do not want to run one of the services above simply comment out or delete the relevant service section from `docker-compose.yml`.*

## How does it work?

This repo relies on Docker Compose to configure and run all of the above services, leveraging Traefik to automatically expose each service, [request and maintain](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/docker-compose/acme-tls/) Let's Encrypt certificates for SSL, and handle all proxying.

## Starting the Services

You will need to clone this repository to the host you want running these services first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethforprivacy/self-hosted-services.git
cd self-hosted-services
```

Once cloned, set the necessary passwords and desired sub-domains in the `.env` file (*PLEASE DO NOT COPY THE FOLLOWING CONFIG, CHANGE THE PASSWORDS AND HOSTNAMES APPROPRIATELY IN YOUR LOCAL `.env` FILE*):

```ini
# Nextcloud Variables
NEXTCLOUD_HOSTNAME=nextcloud.mydomain.com
NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=
NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

# Wallabag Variables
WALLABAG_HOSTNAME=wallabag.mydomain.com
WALLABAG_DB_ROOT_PASS=
WALLABAG_DB_PASS=
WALLABAG_URL=https://wallabag.mydomain.com

# Teddit Variables
TEDDIT_HOSTNAME=teddit.mydomain.com

# Nitter Variables
NITTER_HOSTNAME=nitter.mydomain.com

# Traefik Variables
TRAEFIK_HOSTNAME=traefik.mydomain.com

# Heimdall Variables
DASHBOARD_HOSTNAME=dashboard.mydomain.com
DASHBOARD_TZ=America/New York

# Privatebin Variables
PRIVATEBIN_HOSTNAME=paste.mydomain.com

# Monero explorer variables
EXPLORER_HOSTNAME=explorer.mydomain.com

# Let's Encrypt Variables
LE_EMAIL_ADDRESS=myemail@pm.me
```

Note that all hostnames used must already have DNS entries configured with your domain provider in order for certificate generation to function properly.

Edit the Nitter configuration file:

* Nitter
  * Replace the `hostname`, `replaceTwitter`, and `replaceYouTube` values with the relevant hostnames

* SearXNG
  * Generate MORTY_KEY `sed -i "s|ReplaceWithARealKey\!|$(openssl rand -base64 33)|g" settings.yml .env`
  * go into the settings.yml file and replace the searx.mydomain.com at the bottom of the file with your domain.

* P2Pool
  * Hugepages are very important for optimal mining performance. You need to enable them first using the following commands:
``` bash
sudo sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=3072
sudo bash -c "echo vm.nr_hugepages=3072 >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
```
Note: If your VPS or Server does not have enough RAM you can reduce it by using 1168 instead of 3072

Start-up the services with Docker Compose:

* `docker-compose up -d`

## Tor Support

Currently Monero, P2Pool, Nitter, SearXNG, Invidious, Libretranslate, and Teddit get default Tor support, but I will likely expand that in the future. To list Onion services, simply run:

* `docker exec -ti tor onions`

## Updates

Automatic updates are provided by the [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) container that watches and updates base images of services when available. It will automatically search for, download, and migrate your services to updated images whenever available.

## Logging

If you find yourself in need of viewing logs for a given service, simply run the following to tail all logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow
```

To view the logs of a single service, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow <service_name>
```

i.e.:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow monerod
```
