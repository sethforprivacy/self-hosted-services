# self-hosted-services

This repository contains everything you need to start self-hosting a core set of privacy-preserving services that I have found helpful, all run via a common [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) configuration using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for SSL certificates.

***NOTE: I am in the process of migrating all apps here to [meienberger/runtipi](https://github.com/meienberger/runtipi), as that is a much better overall solution for this type of project. Once done I will archive this repo and direct all users to that. You can follow the porting process here: https://github.com/meienberger/runtipi-appstore/pulls/sethforprivacy***

## How does it work?

This repo relies on Docker Compose to configure and run all of the above services, leveraging Traefik to automatically expose each service, [request and maintain](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/docker-compose/acme-tls/) Let's Encrypt certificates for SSL, and handle all proxying.

## Starting the Services

You will need to clone this repository to the host you want running these services first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethforprivacy/self-hosted-services.git
cd self-hosted-services
```

Once cloned, set the necessary passwords and desired sub-domains in the `.env` file (*PLEASE DO NOT COPY THE FOLLOWING CONFIG, CHANGE THE PASSWORDS AND HOSTNAMES APPROPRIATELY IN YOUR LOCAL `.env` FILE*):

```ini
# Nextcloud Variables
NEXTCLOUD_HOSTNAME=nextcloud.mydomain.com
NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_USER=
NEXTCLOUD_ADMIN_PASSWORD=
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=

# Wallabag Variables
WALLABAG_HOSTNAME=wallabag.mydomain.com
WALLABAG_DB_ROOT_PASS=
WALLABAG_DB_PASS=
WALLABAG_URL=https://wallabag.mydomain.com

# Teddit Variables
TEDDIT_HOSTNAME=teddit.mydomain.com

# Nitter Variables
NITTER_HOSTNAME=nitter.mydomain.com

# Traefik Variables
TRAEFIK_HOSTNAME=traefik.mydomain.com

# Heimdall Variables
DASHBOARD_HOSTNAME=dashboard.mydomain.com
DASHBOARD_TZ=America/New York

# Privatebin Variables
PRIVATEBIN_HOSTNAME=paste.mydomain.com

# Monero explorer variables
EXPLORER_HOSTNAME=explorer.mydomain.com

# Let's Encrypt Variables
LE_EMAIL_ADDRESS=myemail@pm.me
```

Note that all hostnames used must already have DNS entries configured with your domain provider in order for certificate generation to function properly.

Edit the Nitter configuration file:

* Nitter
  * Replace the `hostname`, `replaceTwitter`, and `replaceYouTube` values with the relevant hostnames

* SearXNG
  * Generate MORTY_KEY `sed -i "s|ReplaceWithARealKey\!|$(openssl rand -base64 33)|g" settings.yml .env`
  * go into the settings.yml file and replace the searx.mydomain.com at the bottom of the file with your domain.

* P2Pool
  * Hugepages are very important for optimal mining performance. You need to enable them first using the following commands:
``` bash
sudo sysctl vm.nr_hugepages=3072
sudo bash -c "echo vm.nr_hugepages=3072 >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
```
Note: If your VPS or Server does not have enough RAM you can reduce it by using 1168 instead of 3072

* Conduit
  * Start by planning out your setup. If you are willing to dedicate the domain you want to use as the handle:
  * @user:domain.tld, then just set that in Conduit_Hostname in .env and in conduit/wellknown.conf as the whole <subdomain>.<domain> part
  * If you wish to have a website, or other stuff on that domain instead, then you will need to dive-in some way or another.
  * Let's say you're okay with having the handle look like @user:subdomain.domain.tld, then just set that in the files mentioned above.
  * If you wish, to have the domain in the handle, and in use at the same time, you will need to dive into the docker-compose.yml itself
  * and set the line with comment: `#Change to root domain if desired` to the root domain, otherwise keep the subdomain everywhere else
  * Set up redirect on the route `https://domain.tld/.well-known/matrix/*` to `https://subdomain.domain.tld/.well-known/matrix/:splat`
  * At least this setup was tested. Feel free to come up with easier ways to this setup.
  * Otherwise if you get stuck, leave an issue, someone will surely help out.

Start-up the services with Docker Compose:

* `docker-compose up -d`

## Tor Support

Currently Monero, P2Pool, Nitter, SearXNG, Invidious, Libretranslate, and Teddit get default Tor support, but I will likely expand that in the future. To list Onion services, simply run:

* `docker exec -ti tor onions`

## Updates

Automatic updates are provided by the [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) container that watches and updates base images of services when available. It will automatically search for, download, and migrate your services to updated images whenever available.

## Logging

If you find yourself in need of viewing logs for a given service, simply run the following to tail all logs:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow
```

To view the logs of a single service, run:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow <service_name>
```

i.e.:

```bash
docker-compose logs --follow monerod
```
